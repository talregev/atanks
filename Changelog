      repulsor shields were used with less than ten tanks in the game.
    - Fixed compile errors on Windows.
    - Added function which will create a "music" folder in the .atanks
      config folder.
    - Game will now play wav files which are saved in the .atanks/music
      folder. One track is played each round and looped.
      The wav file must be 16-bit.
    - Added item to main option menu called the Sound menu. The sound menu
      contains all sound related options. Removed sound driver options
      from the Graphics menu.


August 7, 2009
    - Players can now select which sound driver they want. This should
      usually be left on Auto Detect, but Linux users can select from
      a variety of other sound drivers if need be.
    - Saving and loading games is now done using text files again.
    - Settings are saved in regular .txt files again for easy editing.
      The game should automatically switch from the old .dat files.
    - Added --nonetwork command line option to avoid using any
      network server code.


August 1, 2009
    - Fixed bug where pressing a key on the Select Players screen
      would cause the game to run without any players.
    - Removed crash when sound is not properly initalised.
    - Added keybaord support for options menu and select player
      menu. Tab and Backspace switch between fields. ENTER toggles
      toggle boxes. Up and down arrows adjust values. Space is OK
      and ESC is cancel.
    - Removed most un-needed exit calls to avoid having the game crash
      needlessly.
    - Added keyboard support for the main game menu. Tab and Backspace
      navigate the menu. Enter and Spacebar select items. Esc quits
      the game.
    - Added check to make sure unselectable items are not selected
      during the battle.
    - Added a quick note on keybaord controls to the README file.
    - Removed AI's ability to cheat by "megically" getting more money.
    - Made teams divide up money more fairly.
    - Fixed dependencies in the Makefile.
    - Game should no longer crash if a mouse is no present.
    - Added keyboard support to buying screen.


July 25, 2009
    - Created exporter utility, which takes all images out of
      an Allegro datafile and saves the bitmaps in the current
      directory.
    - Replaced all datafiles with sub-directories. This allows easy
      access to view and edit all images and sounds.
    - The game now manually loads all images and sounds
      in the globaldata class.
    - Atanks now uses manually loaded images. Datafiles are no longer
      used. Removed datafiles.
    - Napalm looks a little more firey.
    - Added Rocket item, which shoots the tank up into the air.
    - Fixed drawing of the tank when using the rocket.
    - Reduced cost of auto-repair kit.
    - Added rocket flames.
    - Prevented tank from launching itself into orbit.
    - Rockets can move a tank left or right, depending on the direction of
      the tank gun. Straight up causes the tank not to drift either way.
    - Updated Makefile to handle new image and sound handling.


================== Atanks-3.8 released ============================

July 24, 2009
    - Fixed some code to be more compatible with Windows.

July 16, 2009
    - Fixed bug where the error message would be garbled if no weapons file
      was found. Thanks to BillyBuerger for reporting this bug.
    - Placed virtual object functions back in their source file. Removed
      inline statements.
    - Placed physical object code back in source file. Removed inline
      statements.
    - Funky bomblets (and funky deathlets) now display in different colours.
    - Removed all the un-needed private constructors and deconstructors.
      Removed un-needed inline declarations.
    - Removed white bubbles from menus to improve contrast and reduce
      CPU usage.



July 8, 2009
    - Removed code which caused crash if settings were not saved.
    - Fixed crash in retaliation text code.
    - Added Demo mode. Leaving Atanks on the main menu for one
      minute causes the game to play by itself for five rounds.
      This can be stopped at any time by pressing the ESC key.
    - On Linux, the sky is now generated in a background thread. This
      removes most of the delay at the end of the buying screen, before
      a round starts.
      (I forget who suggested this a year or so back, but I didn't have
       the time to implement it then. I think they were a Java developer
       and they deserve the credit for this idea.)
    - Fixed a problem with cluster bombs not having the proper sub-missile.
    - Moved some floating functions out of atanks.cpp and placed them in
      files.cpp for better access from other source files.
    - Fixed land drawing under threaded mode.
    - Changed war quotes to display in black for better contrast.
    - Fixed blank patches in sky when using threads.



July 4, 2009
    - Changed main game loop to go through objects twice rather than loop
      twice for each class. Should reduce CPU usage by about 5%.
    - Tried to make teams more evenly matched.
    - Added Option menu called "Network".
    - Made checking for updates on the web an option, under the Network menu.
    - Made MIRVs detect their position much more efficently.
    - Created new weapon (Driller), which will dig a deep hole where ever it lands. Does
      minor damage to any tanks hit.

June 27, 2009
    - Added Chain Missile and Jackhammer weapons. (Provided by Yama.)
    - Weapons such as chain gun, chain missile and jack hammer now correctly
      display the number of shots the player has left, rather than the total
      amount of missiles in the spread.
    - In the Store, the correct number of items purchased now show up next to
      items such as the chaingun, chain missile and jack hammer.
    - Updated README file.



============= Atanks-3.7 released ========================================

June 22, 2009
    - Napalm should now fall if no dirt is under it.
    - Player colours should look the same in 16 and 32 bit colour modes now.
    - Cleaned up old fog code.
    - Fixed fan graphic in different colour modes.
    - Game now automatically checks for updates, if the user is running Linux.
      Availible updates are displayed on the main page.

June 19, 2009
    - Added option to allow players not not share money with team mates.
      (menucontent.h, globaldata.h, globaldata.cpp, atanks.cpp)
    - Fixed crash when checking tank status.
      (globaldata.h, player.cpp, tank.cpp)
    - Atanks now uses the desktop's default colour depth. The user
      can over-ride the default by using the "-d" option on the command line.
    - Applied code from Yama to make satellite drawing more smooth. Should
      avoid leaving artifacts.

June 15, 2009
    - Fixed abs() calls in player.cpp and tank.cpp
    - Replaced old Teleport animation with Yama's.

June 4, 2009
    - Added war quotes to display at the end of games. (files.cpp, files.h,
      atanks.cpp (do_winner))
    - Added war_quotes.txt data file with list of quotes about war.
    - Added Reset All button on the options page (atanks.cpp options,
      globaldata.h, globaldata.cpp, evironment.h environment.cpp)
    - Made default colour theme "crispy".
    - Moved do_winner screen up a little to give room to the war quotes.
    - Added option for custom background (menucontent.h, environment.h
      environment.cpp)
    - Any bitmaps found in the config folder (.atanks) can be used
      as custom backgrounds. (files.cpp, files.h, atanks.cpp, environment.h,
      environment.cpp)
    - Added Mass Teleport item, teleports all tanks on the screen to
      random locations. (tank.cpp, weapons.txt, main.h)


================== Atanks-3.6 released ================================

June 1, 2009
    - Fixed Makefile to make sure binary does to correct directory.
    - Moved giant inline function out of header file and into environment.cpp
    - Added deconstructor to ENVIRONMENT class fpr clean-up.

May 19, 2009
    - Settings from previous versions (prior to 3.5) can now be imported.
    - Fixed Makefile to handle changes to source files.
    - Re-added debugging codes to Makefile.
    - Fixed various crashes that would happen with the computer was aiming
      at tanks which had already been destroyed.
    - Prevented tanks from getting credit after they die.
    - Players should no longer show up as winning a round if they have died.
    - New game menu should look better now at higher resolution.
    - When selecting options or game rounds, the options now "wrap" around
      from highest to lowest and lowest to highest.
    - Added menu support for Slovak. (Provided by Jozef.)



==================== Atanks-3.5-r1 released ==========================
March 25, 2009
    - Important Bugfix:
      Fixed a bug that could cause atanks to crash if a game with players which
      do not belong to the first 10 set up players chosen is loaded.
    - Important Bugfix:
      A typo made atanks impossible to be compiled on windows platform

===================== Atanks-3.5 released ============================

March 19, 2009
    - Fixed a bug that caused players to be skipped, if their predecessor died
      during their own attack. (now really working!)
    - rewrote loading and saving of game settings and games.
      Important: Old save games and settings can not be imported!
    - Bots no might a) forget their revenge plans on new rounds, b) drop revenge
      plans if the revengee is on the same team and c) go for the not-same-team
      leader as a new revengee if the difference of won rounds grows too high.
    - Smoke desolves now a bit more realistic.
    - Napalm Jellies now grow first instead of spawning fully sized.
    - If a "winner" dies during end-of-round waiting, the score and money bonuses
      are substracted. (No more "Die-But-Keep-The-Points"-behavior!)
    - Fixed a bug that made Sith go for their team mates in special circumstances.
    - Changed the Makefiles to the new source layout and fixed some issues.
    - dynamized the new targetting system, so that there should be no more "lags"

February 21, 2009
    -- Finally "-Wno-write-strings" is no longer needed to compile the sources
    -- Rewrote the environment method to calculate average background colors. It is
    now inline and somewhat optimized, making shadowed + fading text more
    performant.
    -- Rewrote File handling, apart from three tiny points atanks is now fully ISO
    C++ compliant.
    -- Made rollers a bit faster dropping
    -- No more roller-breaking of shields by hammering them above the enemy onto
    the steel/wrap ceiling! They explode now.
    -- Two tiny patches make bots targetting a bit faster and destroy (hopefully)
    any possibility for the system to go infinite
    -- prepared all neccessary files to be translated. But please note:
    -- English: Is always there
    -- Portuguese: Is borked. But maybe it's only my utf-8 system showing the
    wrong characters. I looked into the atanks-2.9 files and it is broken there as
    well. If its just my system, don't mind. ;)
    -- French: Has some tiny things that has to be translated. Retaliation is
    still english, and I am not sure how to translate "Shadowed Text" and "Fading
    Text", so some french natural speaker might do this?
    -- German: Only weapons_de.txt needs to be translated, I'll do it next year.
    -- Slovak: Only the gloating texts *are* translated so the rest is missing
    completely, but I have prepared the files and menucontent.h for a slovak
    natural speaker to be translated.
    -- Added weapons_*language*.txt files so we can (finally) translate the weapon
    texts as well.
    -- Fixed a bug that could cause roller tracking to go infinite.
    -- Balanced fading texts some more
    -- Corrected some text messages
    -- added new roller code. Rollers now really roll!
    -- fixed a bug that made tracking report wrong hit points when tracking
    rollers and burrowers
    -- Added average background color calculation and fixed fading text offset. It
    should look far better now.
    -- Balanced shadowed text color calculation
    -- added a new retaliation text. When bots aim at opponents they have a grudge
    against, they might tell you now.
    For this to work you'll have to copy retaliation*.txt into
    /usr/share/games/atanks/ (or wherever you have your atanks data files)
    directory.
    -- removed waiting for explosions to finish when tanks blow up after being hit
    by violent death missiles.
    I was longing to change that for ages, because I grew rather sick of tanks
    being suspended in mid-air for ages while all those violent death missile fly
    around. Now, they blow up immediately. However, when a normal missile is shot
    and destroys a tank, it still waits for the missile's explosion to finish.
    -- changed tank falling behavior: They now can fall a short distance (2-5
    pixels) without getting damage and without the parachutes to open.
    I was longing for that one, too. The reason is, that it is madness to waste
    30+ parachutes and/or getting alot of damage while moving (!!) a tank down a
    flat slope.
    -- Fixed a bug with the tracing of spreads which resulted in bots hitting self
    but not the opponent.
    -- added a security check when calculating offsets to napalm. Bots should not
    drop napalm onto themselves any more when trying to hit a neighbor.
    -- added shadows to the text to increase readability. (Has to be turned on in
    the graphics menu, for compatibilities sake this option defaults to "off")
    -- added fading to the text, to ... well... to have a bit of eye candy. ;)
    (Has to be turned on in the graphics menu, for compatibilities sake this
    option defaults to "off")
    -- cleaned up aiming calculation
    -- cleaned up debugging messages for "DEBUG_AIM" and added some more info.
    -- Fixed a bug that could cause riot shots and blasts to start 10-20 pixels
    away from the tank cannon.
    -- Fixed a bug that caused the the aiming system to fail in a very special
    (and rare, but still existing) situation, resulting in bots shooting into the
    ceiling.
    -- Added a cleanup for all objects. No more debris on the screen!
    -- As the new aiming system doesn't need it any more, the wall type and boxed
    mode aren't changed any more once the last human player dies and skipping is
    turned on.
    -- added boxed mode (Finally!)
    -- riot blasts fixed, they no longer shoot downwards when too less power is
    chosen
    -- chain missiles now blast through dirt. (vertical spreads, too)
    -- Walltypes on non-human rounds with skip-AI on will now all change to
    Wrapped Walls & non-Boxed mode, but not before the current destructions
    (violent deaths, falling tanks) are finished. (happy, sylikc? ;))
    -- a completely new aiming system has been written to make the boxed mode
    possible
    -- added tweaks to reduce "debris" left on screen
    -- added tweaks to reduce "choking" of the display when too much is going on
    -- removed HLR_DEBUG, because in over 1000 rounds the speed-up-system never
    failed
    -- There are now three different defines for debugging:
        -- DEBUG
        Will show everything concerning inventories, shopping system, item
        selection and target selection of the bots on the console.
        -- DEBUG_AIM
        Will show all relevant numbers of the new aiming system on the console
        -- DEBUG_AIM_SHOW
        Will draw dots and circles on the screen to make the "thinking" of the
        aiming process visible.
        (Warning: The game is no longer playable in this mode)
    -- balanced computer player values, according to the new aiming system.
    Generally speaking, the "useless" bot won't hit a barn with a pumpgun, while
    the "deadly" bot is very precise.
    -- If no target can be reached by normal means, bots now might teleport (or
    swap) out of their corner, or try to get rid of the obstacle by using riot
    blasts
    -- While aiming bots now try to avoid hitting themselves or team mebers (when
    non-neutral) and are somewhat carefull not to hit themselves or team members
    with the blast damage their weapon produces. If a target can't be hit
    otherwise, there have sacrefices to be made, though...
    -- target selection now uses the new aiming system to value targets lower
    which are hard (or impossible) to hit
    -- item selection now uses the new aiming system to value weapons lower with
    which the chosen target can't be hit properly
    -- The target system now calculates burrowers and rollers. (Which leads to
    some highly entertaining results! :))
    -- The more intelligent a bot is, the more "bounces" of walls or "wraps" it
    can calculate.
    -- The more intelligent a bot is, the more spread it can calculate. So don't
    wonder if a useless or guesser bot fires a super spread, happily hitting
    itself. It simply couldn't see that coming.
    -- Velocity check rewritten. It now a) works and b) fixes the "Repulsor-
    Shield-Bug" :D Yes, I am very happy about that!
    It is handled in three different ways:
        -- No Spring Wall: The limit is set by maximum power, influenced by
        the mass of the weapon.
        -- Spring Wall and Not Boxed: The Limit is doubled, or shooting at the
        wall would destroy your missile.
        -- Spring Wall in a box: The limit is four times the normal limit, or
        it won't be any fun!
        I had very entertaining results with that! :)
    -- hit 2500! This means I have now tested over 2500 rounds with the new
    shopping- and target-selection systems since the last changes and/or bugfixes!
    -- The Boost Value calculation is changed to be more dynamic to future changes
    -- added a private member to count how many boost items are bought
    -- changed boost buying: inserted a per-round-limit aka iBoostItemsBought with
    the help of the above count
    -- language menu fixed
    -- changed interest to be dynamically gained
    -- Added a new define, HLR_DEBUG which, when set, causes the round to end
    after each bot having one last shot if no human players are left. (Default,
    currently, is 16)
    -- Fixed a bug that caused aTanks to freeze for seconds everytime too much is
    going on. (Explo, Text, Smoke, etc.) On some occasions there still can be a
    "hang" for a split second or so. But that could have been my computer, the
    issue needs to be tested and watched.
    -- Started to add boxed mode (not implemented yet! But the menu item is there
    and the Wall-Display is changed)
    -- Fixed a bug causing accelerated AI to crash
    -- Included sylikc's Anti-Crash-Fix
    -- When bots have enough money, they do not spend everything. Jedi keep 50%,
    Neutrals 25% and sith 5% (the squanderers! ;) *hrhr*) for "bad times"
    -- Repulsor Shield handling changed:
        changed ydist to be always negative, so missiles are *always* handled
        like they came from above! It remains to be tested whether this
        balances the repulsor shields, or renders them unbeatable (which could
        happen...)
        Note: In over 500 rounds they perform better, but are still far away
        from being "unbeatable"
    -- When determining pre-Buy items bots enforce buying of boost-Items if they
    are too far away from the peak.
    -- Limit for items raised up to 999 (like humans)
    -- limited AI-Only Rounds. If the last human players dies the remaining bots
    get 10 tries each to find a winner. If they do not succeed, the round is ended
    and the most healthy tank wins. (Or the round draws if two or more are equal)
    I added this, because there is a tiny chance (it never happened in the last
    weeks, but thrice only yesterday!) that the games gos infinite in AI-only
    turns. Situation: bots left have only small missiles and regenerate more each
    round than the small missile delivers.
    With this limit it won't happen any more.
    -- When the last human dies and the wall type is changed, it is redrawn at
    once now.
    -- limited interest && team money
    It is too easy to become super-marvel-universium-mega-hero by just waiting a
    couple of rounds until the bank has pumped up your account to some millions.
    Currently the bank refuses to pay more interest than 100k, but that hard limit
    will be changed to a dynamic one. (see todo list)
    As for team money, bots now refuse to spend more than 500k into the pot.
    Humans, too, of course.
    -- team win->WinRoundBonus divided instead of applied full.
    It is just extremely unfair that the teams get much more money for winning a
    round when it is easier for them to do so.
    -- 75% was too much, thus jedi now only pay 50% into the team account.
    -- Bots try to save up money to get better equipment
    -- Bots look at basic equipment first before heading for the weapons-shop.
        -- Parachutes (if gravity is on)
        -- Basic weapons (aka 5 medium and 3 large missiles
        -- Armor/Amps
        -- "Tools" to free themselves like Riot Blasts
        -- Shields, if enough money is there
        -- if all is set, look for dimpled/slick projectiles!
    Armor/Amps (aka "Boost-Items"), however, are limited, so they will only buy
    them, if someone has a higher value in boost-items. As these items can be
    bought randomly as well, they won't neccessarily wait for the human player(s)
    to go ahead!
    -- Buying is no longer purely random but takes the bots weapon preferences
    into account.
    -- The amount of money a bot wants to save up is used for the target-finding-
    system as well:
    If a bot has less money, it is more likely to target weak opponents to fetch
    the kill-bonus. If it has enough money, it will more likely chose the biggest
    threat.
    -- Money-saving is now limited, so that no bot tries to sum up millions. Right
    now the highest maximum, depending on type and weapon preferences, is 1M.
    (Deadly(=5) * 2 * Armageddon cost)
    -- Teams are now handled differently in alot of places:
        -- Prior the shopping tour, every jedi adds 75%, and every sith 25% of
        their money to the "team-account". The team-money is reduced by a
        "transaction fee" (jedi: 5%, sith: 10%) and then divided onto all
        team-members to help each other out.
        -- While searching for a target jedi try not to hit their team mates,
        while sith do not care so much.
        -- While searching for a target jedi give alot less than neutrals
        about revenge, while sith can become furious (even against team
        members!)
        -- jedi *can* become "super-defensive" (defensive > 1.0) while sith
        *can* become "super-offensive (defensive < -1.0). By this jedi can be
        extremely cautious every now and then, while sith like to throw
        caution out of the window. :)
    -- Riot blasts/bombs are no longer chosen to be shot onto enemies!
    -- fixed a bug with the rating of buried targets while searching for a
    target/chosing an apropriate weapon
    -- target selection and weapon selection now work together:
    A bot choses a weapon and tries to find the best target for it. Then the bot
    decides whether another weapon would be better for that target and switches to
    that. But they value weapons higher they like more, now.
    -- corrected the _targetX modification for shaped charges and napalm:
    Bots trie to aim shaped charges so that they do not directly hit, for aiming
    napalm they try to take wind into account.
    -- added blast check, to avoid using weapons which blast hit self, depending
    on intelligence and defensiveness
    -- added laser check to see whether a laser can be fired or would hit solid
    rock only
    -- added check for buried targets and appropriate weapons (burrower,
    penetrator, tremor-tectonic)
    -- added a check to get more intelligent bots to do collateral damage when
    possible
    -- Added a custom Kamikaze text for the situation when bots decide to blow
    them selves up.
    -- Money interest was added right before entering the shop, resulting in
    interest added everytime a game was reloaded (and reloaded, and reloaded...).
    I changed that so that interest is added after leaving the shop, fixing the
    "Add-money-by-reload"-Bug. Further there is no more interest for money that is
    just earned in the last round.
    -- added offset if no human players left, raising the class of the bots to
    speed up the game without changing the difference in intelligence between bots
    too much.
    -- bots perform best on rubber and wrap walls. If no human players are left,
    the wall type is changed if steel/spring is chosen to speed up the accelerated
    game.
    -- calculation of the shaped charge type weapons was improved (and corrected).
    -- Added preference generation for bots that are set to "per play" when a game
    is loaded. The loading of the preferences is (unfortunately) disabled and I do
    not know why. As long as they *are* disabled, PerPlay-Config bots have to get
    a new config on game load, or they use the global config, rendering PerPlay-
    Config useless.
    -- For PhysObjects: reduced "virtual" height to 25 times screen height and
    changed velocity check for the real velocity and >200 x mass.
    -- Re-Added german language, it flew out of the release.

===================== Atanks-3.2 released ============================

    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Graphics should display properly if the

    -- When the player dies, the game will not skip
    ahead to the end of the round until violent deaths
    are finished.
    (Thanks to Scott for providing this patch.)
    -- Updated Portuguese language files to use latin1
    encoding. Should display better than old files.

    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Re-implemented fog. Made fog smoother, where
    tanks disappear and re-appear.
    -- Fixed medium napalm so it drops napalm, not
    tremors.
    -- The fog option no longer shows up as incomplete.
    -- Massive code clean up. Removed old versions of save/load,
    took out old aiming code. Breaks backward compatiblity with
    versions of Atanks prior to 2.4.

    avoids loading game settings, but still loads
    players, to allow game settings to be reset.
    -- If no tanks fire a shot, natruals are paused until
    someone fires. This fixes two problems:
    A) If you leave the keyboard and come back 5 minutes
       later, there is still some dirt left.
    B) It is not possible to simply buy a lot of parachuts
       and armour and wait for enemy tanks to die from naturals.
    -- Added Physics option "Violent Death" which causes tanks to
    die in violent explosions when turned on. Is left off by default.
    -- Added Land Slide option called "Tank Only", which causes tanks
    to fall, but dirt hover in the air.
    -- Reworked loading players to make it more flexible.
    -- Attempted fix for start-up screen size.

       as a team, the game is a draw.


January 18, 2008
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)

       while still above the ground.
    -- Created MIRV images.


January 7, 2008
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Introduced Campaign mode, which causes the AI
    to get progressively smarter each round.
    -- Removed liquid.cc from source tree.
    -- Removed list.cc and list.h from source tree.
    -- AI players randomly select weapons rather than
       using an item until they run out.


December 28, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Firing a chian missile no longer fires another

    -- Wrap around walls are now displayed using the colour yellow.

November 29, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Fixed bug where, if a tank shoots itself and falls
    and the money penalty for self-damage drops the player's money
    below $0, then the money is "corrected" to $1,000,000,000.
    Thanks to Andy for pointing this out.
    -- If both teams have the same number of wins, then
    the game is a draw.
    -- Game settings are saved along with the saved game.
    Settings are saved in the same directory as the saved game
    as a .txt (plain text) file. Replacing your atanks-config.txt
    file with this will give you the same game settings as you had
    while playing the original game.
    -- Display directions for saving game on buying screen.
    -- Added fuel item, which allows the player's tank to
    move using the < and > keys (or period and comma).

    to "Ranger" to make it fit in the text box.
    -- Windows version now saves settings and saved games
    under user's AppData folder, rather than current working
    directory.
    -- Atanks will attempt to create a sub-directory in the user's
    HOME directory called .atanks. The config file will be
    copied there, if it exists. If the file does not yet exist,
    future config files will be saved there.
    Note: The game does not attempt to copy saved game files.
    -- Saved games are now saved and loaded from the player's
    HOME/.atanks/ directory.

    when the target dies only. Tanks do not
    gloat for near-deaths.


October 14, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Game speed is now adjustable through the Graphics
    option menu.
    Adjusting the game speed may help avoid errors where
    the game would lockup before.
    -- Rollers now hit Steel walls and fall normally instead
    of instantly appearing at the bottom of the screen.
    -- When the player pressed a key in the range of 0-9
    the tank's team name is displayed along with the health status.

August 11, 2007

    its constructor. Text is now allocated and freed outside of
    the class for easier debugging.

    -- Players now try to avoid shooting fellow team mates.
    Neutral players are not considered members of a team.

    -- When only the members of one team are alive, the round
    is over. Neutral players are not considered a team.

    -- At the end of the game, teams are credited with wins.

    -- Minor Makefile typo corrections.


August 4, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- When tanks talk, the text is selected using
    Random_Line (new function) rather than the
    previously used LINESEQ for increased flexibility.

    -- Player can now switch languages without re-starting
    the game.

    -- Added new colour theme, provided by Jim of the FreeDOS
    project. The colour theme can be changed in the Graphics
    menu. The options are "Regular" for the original theme and

    changed. To see different explosions currently requires
    a game restart.

    -- Added Team option to the Player menu. Possible teams
    are Sith, Neutral and Jedi.
    Note: Teams do not have any effect on the game, yet.

    -- Updated the Help.txt file. Thanks to Fred for pointing
    out the incorrect text.

    -- Removed AutoPlay option from the main Options menu
    under Auto-Skip as it seems to be redundant.

    -- Fixed Cartoon gravity to make it more cartoony.

    have cumlitive effect.


July 29, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)

    the landscape to hover for a variable amount of time.

    -- Tanks now hover for a few seconds when using
    Cartoon gravity.

    -- Reduced CPU usage when displaying the main menu.

    -- Added Portuguese language files for gloat, revenge,
    suicide and Help. Added menu option called Languages
    to allow the player to switch between English and
    Portuguese. Thanks to Fred for the translations.


July 25, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- When you drop a burrower or penterator onto
    a Steel floor, the game no longer hangs.

    holding the CONTROL key while clicking on an item

    the game no longer requires a restart for the setting
    to take effect.
    -- When switching between Default OS mouse cursor and
    the Custom Atanks cursor, the change no longer
    requires a game restart.
    -- If the constant "DOS" is defined, the background
    should not be cached. This should fix weird menu issue on DOS.
    -- When Steel walls are in effect, the computer usually
    avoids shooting them.
    -- When a new player is created, their default colour is
    a high contrast to avoid blending.
    -- Max missile age has been changed from 60 seconds to
    20 seconds to speed up game play.

June 10, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- In rest points, Linux uses usleep() and Windows
    now uses native Sleep() call to avoid high CPU usage.
    -- If there are no tanks alive at the end of a round
    the game annouces a "Draw" and no one gets credit for
    a win.
    -- Try to avoid sub-index in tank::draw function.
    -- Draw tank base _after_ the shield to avoid dis-colouration.

June 6, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Removed Windows version of LINUX_SLEEP to avoid
    very slow response from the game.
    -- Put set_display_switch_mode() call in init_game_settings()
    for Windows to avoid pausing the game when the window
    loses focus.
    -- Wall type indicator no longer appears across the top of the
    screen. On the walls and floor only, where wall type
    actually matters.

June 2, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Config settings are now stored in a text file
    called .atanks-config.txt
    The old config files can still be read for backward
    compatibility.
    -- A new wall type (random) has been added, which causes the
    type of wall to change each round.
    -- The side of the screen now shows a thin band of colour which
    indicates which wall type is being used. Red for Steel, Green
    for Rubber and Blue for Spring.

May 14, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Windows build now uses rest() calls where Linux uses usleep
    in the hope of reducing CPU usage on Win32 systems.
    -- Pressing the 0-9 keys will display the coresponding tank's
    name, health and shield status. This information is removed
    from the top bar when a weapon is fired.

    -- Created files.h to hold common file defines and data.
    -- Increased the delay in LINUX_SLEEP to 10000 (on Linux)
    to reduce CPU usage.
    -- When printing Credits and Help, we now use the Allegro
    rest() function to reduce CPU usage. Estimated 3x easier
    on CPU usage.

    -- Moved BUTTON code out of atanks.cc into its
    own source file (button.cc).
    -- Added checks at the top of header files weapons.h,
    player.h and menucontent.h to avoid duplicate defines.

================== Atanks-2.3 Released ========================

April 3, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Changed title screen. Art provided by Keilaron.
    -- Settings are saved as soon as the player leaves the
    Option screen. This avoids losing settings if the game
    crashes or exits unexpectedly.


March 27, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Changed the Auto-repair kit from tech level 4
    to tech level 2.


March 21, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- The player can now select to use either the custom
    Atomic Tanks mouse cursor or the default OS cursor.
    Note: The OS cursor is probably faster.
    The option is located under the Graphics menu and
    may require the game be restarted to take effect.
    -- The ENTER key on the number pad can now be used
    to indicate you are done entering text on Options
    and Player editing screens.


March 18, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- When the player presses TAB or BACKSPACE to change
    weapons, the weapon text no longer flickers. The text
    no longer flickers at the begining of new rounds.
    -- The CTRL key now works to more finely tune PGUP and
    PGDW commands. Of course, this still causes the power to
    vary a lot (100 points per tap).
    -- Created new device called "Fan" which changes the direction
    and strength of the wind. The change in wind depends on the
    direction of the player's turret and the power behind the "shot".
    This only really works well in high-wind environments.


March 15, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Changed drawing code so that different tank
    styles can have the turrent in different positions.
    See tank::draw()
    -- When exiting the game to the main menu, the next game no
    longer speeds up dramatically.
    -- Fixed bug on Windows where exiting the game
    causes all tanks to fire their weapons.
    See tank::activateSelection()


March 12, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- The spelling of "lazer" has been changed to "laser".
    -- Items that are not weapons are no longer displayed
    left-aligned on the top bar. they are right-aligned like
    the other items.
    -- The Page Up and Page Down keys now cause the player's
    power to go up or down dramatically (100 points instead of 5).
    -- Players can now choose to make their tanks
    appear differently. The options are Normal or Classic.
    This is changed in the Players menu.
    -- Tank style preferences are now saved in the config file.


March 6, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Human players can now be put under temporary
    computer control (highest AI setting). This can
    be done during the player's turn by pressing F10.

    -- Repair kit's name changed to Auto-repair kit
    to reflect its ability to repair without user intervention.

    -- Text colour in Help and Credits changed to white from
    black to increase contrast.

    -- If a player is saved as a part time bot, then they
    are re-loaded as a human player.


================== Atanks-2.2 released ===========================

Feb 27, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- We now save the Wind Strength option properly from
    the Weather menu.
    -- Avoid segfault when displaying gloating messages.
    -- Meteors only live for 5 seconds. This is to prevent loops
    where lots of meteors appear and don't self destruct, causing
    an endless loop.
    -- Meteors no longer fall while players are aiming in SIMUL turn
    mode. They will fall at any time in other turn modes. Meteors will
    also fall in SIMUL turn mode while weapons are in the air.
    Note: Lightning remains the same as before.


Feb 24, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Cleared up some compiler warnings we were getting from
    the Windows compiler. Shouldn't effect game play at all,
    but makes the build process nicer.
    -- Added a device called Swapper, which will cause the
    player's tank to switch places with another tank. The
    other tank is picked at random.
    -- Added a new wall type, Spring. The spring wall type
    causes missiles to bounce off the walls and floor
    with more speed (x1.25) than they had before.
    -- When one player kills another, the attacker gloats.
    Only one gloat message is displayed if multiple tanks
    are destroyed.


Feb 21, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Disabled window closing in Windows to prevent hangs.
    -- Added item: repair kit. A device which will slowly
    repair the player's tank each turn.
    -- The number of rounds of play remaining
    can be adjusted on the buying screen.
    This is performed using the "-" and "+" signs on the keyboard.
    Note, the "=" will also act like a "+" to add rounds.
    -- Clear key buffer before accepting input from each player
    to prevent accidently fireing a weapon.


Feb 19, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Expanded final score box to prevent
    money from running on to the background.
    -- The mouse wheel can now be used to scroll through
    items on the buying screen. Makes navigator quicker.
    -- Game now clears keybaord buffer at the end of each turn.
    Avoids weapons being un-intentionally activated.

Feb 13, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Permissions on title.dat changed to 644. Corrects
    bug where a system-wide install would run for root only.


==================== Atanks-2.1 released ==========================

Feb 11, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Added an option under the optins->Physics menu
    to change the type of wall being used during the game.
    The types are Rubber and Steel. Rubber acts as before,
    allowing missiles to bounce off the walls and bottom of
    the screen. The steel walls cause missiles to detonate on
    impact.
    -- Added the wall type option to the config file to
    allow the setting to be saved.
    -- When pressing the BACKSPACE key during the game, players
    can cycle backward through their weapon selections.
    -- Changed computer's targeting AI so the computer understands
    the difference between rubber walls and steel walls. This prevents
    the computer from shooting at steel walls repeatedly.


Feb 9, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Option to enable or disable sound is now on
    the main Options menu. At this time, changing the
    sound on/off will not take effect until the game
    is re-started.
    -- Changed config file to save the sound option.
    -- Made sure the command line option "--nosound"
    over-rides the sound setting in the config file.
    -- The width and height of the Atanks window can now be
    changed from the Options menu, under Graphics. Changes
    take effect after the game is exited and re-started.
    -- Added screen width and height to the config file.
    -- Made sure the command line given width or height
    takes priority over the width and height settings from
    the config file.
    -- Tank health is now printed in the same colour as the
    player's tank.


Feb 5, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Corrected bug where missles would not die from old
    age. Missles should now properly detonate after 60
    seconds (MAX_MISSLE_AGE) whether they hit anything.
    This is to avoid infinate loops where missles bouce
    forever.
    -- Corrected problem with text lingering from the end
    of one round and showing up in the next. Insults should
    no longer carry over into the new round.


Jan 31, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- The player's name now appears over their tank. Text
    colour matches the tank's colour.
    -- Changed money to signed int. Cleared up some
    type problems. Put in check to keep money from
    over-flowing. See Player::newRound()
    -- Command-line option "--noname" added to allow the
    player name above tank feature to be disabled.


Jan 27, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Allow player names to be more than 10 characters. Names
    should now be able to expand to 23. Changed some output
    code to allow for longer names without over-writing other
    text on the screen. Changed file format to allow longer names
    and backward compatibility.

Jan 25, 2007
     Mike (CaptainNeeda+atanks@gmail.com)
    -- Added feature to allow all tanks to fire at the same time.
    This is accessible by selecting "Simul" under Turn Order
    in the options menu.


Jan 21, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Floating text no longer carries over to the next round.
       Added newRound() function to FLOATTEXT object.
    -- When the window's "X" or close button is clicked, the game
       will exit immediately.

=============== Atanks-2.0 Released ===========================

Jan 10, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Fixed serious bug which causes game to crash
    when there are more than two players.

Jan 9, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Corrected serious bug where tanks did not take damage
    when they free-fall.

Jan 7, 2007
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Removed custom my_abs() function. Replaced it
    with built-in fabs().
    -- Where a char variable is used as a boolean, change the
    type to int or bool to avoid compiler warnings.
    -- Created a Debian spefic Makefile (Makefile.debian)
    to make Atanks more compatible with Debian's package.


Dec 19, 2006
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Version information is now displayed on the
    command line properly at start up. This should
    clear up some confusion about what version we have
    during debuging.
    Note: Version number is stored in Makefile
    -- Fixed command line option for height. "-h" was
    already being used for "help". Height can now be
    given using "-t" or "--tall".
    -- When one tank falls on another, the falling tank
    now rests on top of the other, rather than over-lapping
    on the screen.
    -- Added command line option "--nosound" to disable
    game sounds.
    -- Updated command line help.
    -- Re-wrote README file to be more up-to-date and
    organized.
    -- Updated Makefiles. Create new Makefile.windows for
    people compiling on Win32 systems.
    Use "make Makefile.windows" to compile.


Dec 4, 2006
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- When a player runs out of ammo, the game switches
    to a different type of ammo. The new ammo is displayed
    in flashing RED instead of BLACK to warn the player.

Nov 27, 2006
    Jesse (jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca)
    -- Made code compatible with gcc 4.1
    -- Updated code to use current Allegro 4.2 API
       text output functions, set_clip and text_mode
    -- Made player money unsigned to avoid negative funds.
    -- When player runs out of a type of ammo, game automatically
       switches to a new ammo type.

        players remain, goes into Accelerated AI mode (Doesn't draw
        anything, speeds up the game and ends the round quicker,
        less sitting around waiting).
    -- Added option for Accelerated AI
    -- Added incremental stepping of angle and power via ctrl being
        held down (Patrick Bogen's suggestion)

        overwritten before it made it to CVS.

22. 08 .2003 - Tom Hudson (tom@singular.org.uk)
    -- Added checks for memory allocation failures and handle them

        rather than the screen.

15. 12 .2003 - Tom Hudson (tom@singular.org.uk)
